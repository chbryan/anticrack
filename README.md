# Anticrack

Suite of bash scripts to block major tech companies' domains, IPs, services, tracking, and software on Debian Linux systems. Prevents surveillance, adware, and asset operation from Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook.

## Overview

Each script targets one company:
- `anticrack-google.sh`: Blocks Google domains (e.g., google.com, doubleclick.net), IP ranges, removes packages (e.g., google-chrome-stable, chromium), sets non-Google DNS.

- `anticrack-microsoft.sh`: Blocks Microsoft domains (e.g., telemetry, azure), IP ranges, removes packages (e.g., microsoft-edge-stable, teams, code), sets non-Microsoft DNS.

- `anticrack-amazon.sh`: Blocks Amazon domains (e.g., AWS trackers), IP ranges, removes packages (e.g., aws-cli), sets non-Amazon DNS.

- `anticrack-facebook.sh`: Blocks Meta domains (e.g., facebook.com, instagram.com), IP ranges, removes packages (e.g., meta*, facebook*), sets non-Meta DNS.

Scripts use /etc/hosts for domain redirection to 0.0.0.0, iptables for IP blocking, apt for package purge. Toggleable with enable/disable commands.
